  "readme": "# jsSHA\nA JavaScript implementation of the complete Secure Hash Standard family\n(SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA3-224, SHA-256, SHA3-256, SHA-384, SHA3-384, SHA-512,\nSHA3-512, SHAKE128, and SHAKE256) as well as HMAC by Brian Turek.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Caligatio/jsSHA.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Caligatio/jsSHA)\n\n## About\njsSHA is a javaScript implementation of the complete Secure Hash Algorithm\nfamily as defined by\n[FIPS PUB 180-4](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf) and\n[FIPS PUB 202](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.202.pdf).  It also\nincludes the HMAC algorithm with SHA support as defined by\n[FIPS PUB 198-1](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips198-1/FIPS-198-1_final.pdf).\n\n## Files\n**src/sha\\_dev.js**\n\nA commented implementation of the entire SHA family of hashes. Not to be used\nin production.\n\n**src/sha.js**\n\nA Google Closure Compiler optimized version of the entire library.\n\n**src/sha1.js**\n\nA Google Closure Compiler optimized version the library with non SHA-1\nfunctionality removed.\n\n**src/sha256.js**\n\nA Google Closure Compiler optimized version the library with non SHA-224/SHA-256\nfunctionality removed.\n\n**src/sha3.js**\n\nA Google Closure Compiler optimized version the library with non SHA-3\nfunctionality removed.\n\n**src/sha512.js**\n\nA Google Closure Compiler optimized version the library with non SHA-384/SHA-512\nfunctionality removed.\n\n**test/test.html**\n\nMocha/Chai test page that runs all the tests.\n\n**test/genHashRounds.py**\n\nA Python2 script that generates multi-round hash values.\n\n**test/genShake.py**\n\nA Python2 script that generates SHAKE hash values.\n\n**test/sha3.py**\n\nA Python reference implementation of the SHA3 family of hashes.\n\n**build/make-release**\n\nA Bash script that runs the various Google Closure Compiler commands to build\na release.\n\n**build/externs.js**\n\nFile needed solely to make the Google Closure Compilter work.\n\n## Usage\n\n### Browser\nInclude the desired JavaScript file (sha.js, sha1.js, sha256.js, sha512.js, or\nsha3.js) in your header (sha.js used below):\n\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/path/to/sha.js\"></script>\n\n#### Hashing\nInstantiate a new jsSHA object with the desired hash type, input type, and\noptions as parameters.  The hash type can be one of SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA3-224,\nSHA-256, SHA3-256, SHA-384, SHA3-384, SHA-512, SHA3-512, SHAKE128, or SHAKE256.\nThe input type can be one of HEX, TEXT, B64, BYTES, or ARRAYBUFFER.  You can\nthen stream in input using the `update` object function.  Finally, simply call\n`getHash` with the output type as a parameter (B64, HEX, BYTES, or ARRAYBUFFER).\nExample to calculate the SHA-512 of \"This is a test\":\n\n\tvar shaObj = new jsSHA(\"SHA-512\", \"TEXT\");\n\tshaObj.update(\"This is a test\");\n\tvar hash = shaObj.getHash(\"HEX\");\n\nThe constructor takes a hashmap as a optional third argument with possible\nproperties of `numRounds` and `encoding`.  `numRounds` controls the number of\nhashing iterations/rounds performed and defaults to a value of 1 if not\nspecified. `encoding` specifies the encoding used to encode TEXT-type inputs.\nValid options are \"UTF8\", \"UTF16BE\", and \"UTF16LE\", it defaults to \"UTF8\".\n\n`getHash` also takes a hashmap as an optional second argument.  By default the\nhashmap is `{\"outputUpper\" : false, \"b64Pad\" : \"=\"}`.  These options are\nintelligently interpreted based upon the chosen output format. **Important**: \nSHAKE128 and SHAKE256 require `shakeLen` to be included in the hashmap where\n`shakeLen` is the desired output length of the SHAKE algorithm in a multiple\nof 8 bits.\n\n#### HMAC\nInstantiate a new jsSHA object the same way as for hashing.  Then set the HMAC\nkey to be used by calling `setHMACKey` with the key and its input type (this\nMUST be done before calling update).  You can stream in the input using the\n`update` object function just like hashing.  Finally, get the HMAC by calling\nthe `getHMAC` function with the output type as its argument.  Example to\ncalculate the SHA-512 HMAC of the string \"This is a test\" with the key \"abc\":\n\n\tvar shaObj = new jsSHA(hashType, \"TEXT\");\n\tshaObj.setHMACKey(\"abc\", \"TEXT\");\n\tshaObj.update(\"This is a test\");\n\tvar hmac = shaObj.getHMAC(\"HEX\");\n\n`setHMACKey` takes the same input types as the constructor and `getHMAC` takes the\nsame inputs as `getHash` as described above.\n\nNote: You cannot calculate both the hash and HMAC using the same object.\n\n### Node.js\njsSHA is available through NPM and be installed by simply doing\n\n\tnpm install jssha\nTo use the module, first require it using:\n\n\tjsSHA = require(\"jssha\");\n\nThe rest of the instructions are identical to the [Browser](#browser) section above.\n\n## Compiling\nThis library makes use of the [Google Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler)\nto both boost performance and reduce filesizes.  To compile sha\\_dev.js into a customized output file,\nuse a command like the following:\n\n\tjava -jar compiler.jar --define=\"SUPPORTED_ALGS=<FLAG>\" \\\n\t\t--externs /path/to/build/externs.js --warning_level VERBOSE \\\n\t\t--compilation_level ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS \\\n\t\t--js /path/to/sha_dev.js --js_output_file /path/to/sha.js\n\nwhere FLAG is a bitwise OR of the following values:\n\n* 8 for SHA3\n* 4 for SHA-384/SHA-512\n* 2 for SHA-224/256\n* 1 for SHA-1\n\n## Contact Info\nThe project's website is located at [http://caligatio.github.com/jsSHA/](http://caligatio.github.com/jsSHA/)\n\n## Donations\nFeel like donating?
